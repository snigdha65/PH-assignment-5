                <h3>Question 1. what is dom?</h3>
                <p>Answer: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of HTML or XML documents as a tree of objects. It allows web developers to use languages like JavaScript to interact with and dynamically modify web page content without reloading the entire page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Question 2. How to select element from DOM?</h3>
                <p>Answer : You can select elements from the DOM using methods like `querySelector()` or `getElementById()` in JavaScript, providing a way to target and manipulate specific elements on a web page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Question 3. what is event bubble? </h3>
                <p>Event bubbling is a behavior in the DOM where an event triggered on a nested element will also trigger its parent elements' corresponding event handlers, propagating up the DOM tree. This can lead to multiple elements responding to a single event.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Question 4.How the callback function works? </h3>
                <p>A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed later, often in response to an event or asynchronous operation. It allows for dynamic and asynchronous programming by defining behavior that occurs when a specific condition or action is met.</p>
